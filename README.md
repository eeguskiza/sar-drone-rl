## 📋 Overview

This project implements and compares deep reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous quadcopter navigation using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab. The Crazyflie 2.x drone learns to navigate to target positions, with progressive difficulty through curriculum learning.

**Key Features:**
- High-performance parallel simulation (8,192+ environments)
- Algorithm comparison: PPO vs SAC
- Curriculum learning with obstacle avoidance
- RTX 5070 Ti (Blackwell) optimized
